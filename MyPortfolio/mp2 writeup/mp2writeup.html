      <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
      <p> 
        For this project, we were assigned to work with P5JS when constructing a set of sketches with six different focuses: Static, Random,
        Infinite Loop, Interactive, Audio, and Audio & Visual. My sketch gallery can be found <a href="https://cramos03.github.io/MyPortfolio/mp2%20writeup/gallery.html">here</a>.<br><br>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="mp2gif.gif" class="a">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        When beginning this project, I took inspiration from Piet Mondrian and art styles
        with color blocking to see if this could be replicated with a screen saver in mind. This inspiration can be seen in my gif above.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
        When looking at the steps I took to complete this project, it first started with familiarizing myself with using the p5 editor page
        and the examples proivded to us by Hannah in class. These helped very much with understanding certain aspects of what was being displayed,
        and either learning how to replicate it or reshape it to match my own needs was an important starting point.<br><br>
        From here, I wanted to move forward with my inspiration shared above and think of a sequence of sketches that could be connected in style when
        building from one requirement to another. With this in mind, I began sketching my first static sketch in order to set the foundation for what I may
        or may not want to use in the following sketches.<br><br>
        When it came to my random sketch, I settled on randomizing the size for each shape every time the page is reloaded. This was accomplished by adding
        a min and max to the size for each shape and randomzing the selection every time.<br><br>
        For my infinite loop sketch, I began working on the scrren saver style aspect to my sketch by having the resized shapes move within the boundary of
        my screen. This took the most work by needing to figure out how to not only have each shape move at its own unique speed, but also come back once it
        had hit the edge.<br><br>
        After that, my interactive sketch was pretty straight forward in adding a color randomizer to my sketches every time the mouse is being clicked. This
        just rquired a lot of tedious work in setting up a value at the start of my code for each shape and then randomizing it as well.
        Following this, I went ahead and worked on the audio sketch which was a simple button (in the form of square that matched my other sketches) that would
        begin playing a jaoanese jazz song I found on the internet. I wanted to use this to keep the theme of a screensaver and having a relaxing song play to be
        used later in my next sketch as well.<br><br>
        After this, I went ahead and finished off my final sketch by adding another song to another shape. Included in this was the need to make sure it is also
        being stopped once clicked again that way the songs don't play on top of one another without any way to stop it. Since I fell sick during the course of this
        project, I missed two crucial days in adding the rest of the songs to the other shapes, as well as potentially figuring out how this would work if the shapes
        matched sketch four with ongoing movement.

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
        One issue I ran into during this assignment was sketch three, having my shapes move infinitely without leaving the screen boundaries. I was very lost when it
        came to beginning this sketch since I wasn't sure how to set a speed at which I'd want each shape to move at.<br><br>
        I solved this issue when seeking help from The Coding Train who had an excellent video on making an object move and return back once it hit the "walls" of the
        computer screen. I used this starting point and it applied it to every shape I had in order to make what is seen in my sketch three gif above.
        </p>
      <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
        For the future, here are some additional ideas/features I might like to add to my sketches:
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Add more songs to the rest of my shapes in sketch six</li>
            <li>Add movement to sketch six while being able to play and stop songs</li>
            <li>Refine randomized shape sizing that way they don't overlap as poorly, preventing songs from being played on top of one another.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
        A kudos I'd like to give is to The Coding Train who helped me with starting my third sketch when adding movement to my objects.<br><br>
