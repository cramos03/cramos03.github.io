      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        When analyzing the steps I took to complete my page, it mainly began with familiarizing myself with
        the template that was provided to begin this assignment.<br><br>
        Since I had little to no HTML & CSS experience, it took me a while to feel comfortable with making any
        significant changes right out of the gate. Instead, I decided to start practicing these skills by changing
        the provided template and identifying the effect that came about and how it occurred. This allowed me to better
        understand each piece that was playing a role in the three sub-pages.<br><br>
        Following this, I went ahead and began setting up a very basic landing page to my portfolio that would contain
        my sub-pages and a small intro to who I am. This consisted of adding a photo and some information from my other
        portfolio I currently have. Similarly, I followed the same process for my "Bio" page when extracting information
        from my existing portfolio page to provide more context as to who I am.<br><br>
        After this, I went ahead and finalized my portfolio for this assignment by setting up my cheat sheet sub-page where
        I would be keeping any tips & tricks used throughout the quarter.
      </p>
      <h2>Issue</h2>
        <p>
        One issue I ran into during this assignment was attempting to setup left-aligned and right-aligned text on the same line.
        This would be used for establishing a header for my portfolio to both identify ownership, as well as to allow any visitors
        to navigate between sub-pages.<br><br>
        I solved this issue by placing my name and sub-pages within the same header, but then aligning my sub-pages to the right via
        my CSS using float.
        </p>
      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
        <p>
        For my CSS transition, I wanted to start off with something basic, yet still effective when it came to functionality. With this
        in mind, I settled on implementing a transition between colors when hovering over text within my header. This was important for me
        since I really enjoy visual cues for when interacting with a specific feature on a web page, such as a hyperlink. <br><br>
        To accomplish this, I had a few trial and errors with varying CSS formats. However, what worked for me best was implementing a style
        element when anchored to the text of my headers. This looked something like... <br><br>
        a {<br>
            margin: 20px;<br>
            -webkit-transition: color 1s;<br>
            transition: color 0s;<br>
        }<br>
        a:hover {<br>
            color: #c7c8a4;<br>
        }<br>
        </p>
      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
        For the future, here are some additional ideas/features I might like to add to my site:
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Add header to other sub-pages (allows to navigate without using back arrow)</li>
            <li>Add work from prior projects and classes that I've completed</li>
            <li>Add more info to my bio along with accompanying photos</li>
            <li>Further overall design changes to make my portfolio more professional</li><br><br>
          </ul>
