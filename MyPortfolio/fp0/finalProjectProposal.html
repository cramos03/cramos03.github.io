        <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          For my final project I plan on using P5 to create a paint-like drawing app, which lets the user download their art once they've completed their work.
          I've sketched out two drawings to mock-up a potential interface that I intend on embedding into the design for my application. These can be seen below:
          <br><br>
          <div class="img" style="text-align:center">
            <img src="prototype.png" class="a">
            <img src="finalproject.png" class="a">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          As seen in my image above, I wanted to make it a two player game of Pong where I assigned the up and down arrow keys for the right
          paddle, while the W and S keys were assigned to the left paddle. Furthermore, my intention for this game was to have the ball launch in a random
          direction at the start to begin the match. I went with this option since I noticed that in the P5 library of Demos provided to us would land in
          a constant back and forth if neither player moved their paddle. My game is still under production since the ball does not continue moving once the
          game has begun and the paddles don't allow for repsonses when my keys are pressed.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Prototype Version</h2>
          <p>
          When considering a minimal version that demonstrates the core features of my app, I'd like to implement a brush (aka the mouse) with an attached color and brush stroke/size.<br><br>
          For my overall layout, I'll first aim to be able to draw and erase work on a canvas space. I'll attach a pencil and eraser icon to the side to distinguish the tool that is being used from one another. 
          If I have a bit more time I'll shoot towards implementing some sort of color selector in the form of a color wheel for an easy visualization as well.
          </p>
        <h2>Final Version</h2>
          <p>
          What I envision for my final version builds off of my prototype. I'll maintain the color wheel as a color selector, but will also implement a storke/brush size selector
          in the form of a slider. This will help with adding detailed art to user's project rather than using the same brush size for the entire thing. If I have even more time, I'll experiement with adding
          different brush styles. This can be in the form of fade or blur tools, or even the brush shape itself.
          </p>
        <h2>Step-by-Step Plan</h2>
          <p>
          Below is the step-by-step plan for my development process when creating my project:
          <ol style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Review class activity for creating continuous circles that will act as my brush</li>
              <li>Assign circle icon for changing brush color when clicked (do the same for eraser with matching background color)</li>
              <li>Use download example shared with Hannah to download art (saveCanvas tool)</li>
          <b>Completed Milestone 1: Prototype Version</b>
              <li>Create tool bar on the side of my canvas</li>
              <li>Create color wheel through P5 example and save color code to be used for brush color</li>
              <li>Set up slider for circle size (aka brush size)</li>
              <li>Update icon for eraser tool</li>
              <li>Add labels to each tool</li>
          <b>Completed Milestone 2: Final Version</b>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <h2>Known Unknowns</h2>
          <p>
          Below is a list of things I don't currently know how to do, but know that I will have to figure out to complete this project:
          <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Create a color wheel</li>
              <li>Develop varying brush styles (faded, blur, etc.)</li>
              <li>Add a slider for varying brush size, and keep this slider for different brush shapes</li>
              <li>Allow a user to download their art that only captures their canvas</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
          <p>
          <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Preloaded background images to choose from</li>
              <li>Upload an image to begin drawing on</li>
              <li>Add a score cap so that the game will end and announce the winner once this threshold is met</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
