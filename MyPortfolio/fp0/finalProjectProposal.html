        <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          For my final project I plan on using P5 to create a paint-like drawing app, which lets the user download their art once they've completed their work.
          I've sketched out two drawings to mock-up a potential interface that I intend on embedding into the design for my application. These can be seen below:
          <br><br>
          <div class="img" style="text-align:center">
            <img src="prototype.png" class="a">
            <img src="finalproject.png" class="a">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          As seen in my image above, I wanted to make it a two player game of Pong where I assigned the up and down arrow keys for the right
          paddle, while the W and S keys were assigned to the left paddle. Furthermore, my intention for this game was to have the ball launch in a random
          direction at the start to begin the match. I went with this option since I noticed that in the P5 library of Demos provided to us would land in
          a constant back and forth if neither player moved their paddle. My game is still under production since the ball does not continue moving once the
          game has begun and the paddles don't allow for repsonses when my keys are pressed.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Prototype Version</h2>
          <p>
          When considering a minimal version that demonstrates the core features of my app, I'd like to implement a brush (aka the mouse) with an attached color and brush stroke/size.<br><br>
          For my overall layout, I'll first aim to be able to draw and erase work on a canvas space. I'll attach a pencil and eraser icon to the side to distinguish the tool that is being used from one another. 
          If I have a bit more time I'll shoot towards implementing some sort of color selector in the form of a color wheel for an easy visualization as well.
          </p>
        <h2>Final Version</h2>
          <p>
          What I envision for my final version builds off of my prototype. I'll maintain the color wheel as a color selector, but will also implement a storke/brush size selector
          in the form of a slider. This will help with adding detailed art to user's project rather than using the same brush size for the entire thing. If I have even more time, I'll experiement with adding
          different brush styles. This can be in the form of fade or blur tools, or even the brush shape itself.
          </p>
        <h2>Step-by-Step Plan</h2>
          <p>
          Below is the step-by-step plan for my development process when creating my project:
          <ol style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Review class activity for creating continuous circles that will act as my brush</li>
              <li>Assign circle icon for changing brush color when clicked (do the same for eraser with matching background color)</li>
              <li>Use download example shared with Hannah to download art (saveCanvas tool)</li>
          <b>Completed Milestone 1: Prototype Version</b>
              <li>Create tool bar on the side of my canvas</li>
              <li>Create color wheel through P5 example and save color code to be used for brush color</li>
              <li>Set up slider for circle size (aka brush size)</li>
              <li>Update icon for eraser tool</li>
              <li>Add labels to each tool</li>
          <b>Completed Milestone 2: Final Version</b>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <h2>Known Unknowns</h2>
          <p>
          Below is a list of things I don't currently know how to do, but know that I will have to figure out to complete this project:
          <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Create a color wheel</li>
              <li>Develop varying brush styles (faded, blur, etc.)</li>
              <li>Add a slider for varying brush size, and keep this slider for different brush shapes</li>
              <li>Allow a user to download their art that only captures their canvas</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
          <p>
          <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
              <li>Preloaded background images to choose from</li>
              <li>Upload an image to begin drawing on</li>
              <li>Add a score cap so that the game will end and announce the winner once this threshold is met</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          </p>
        <h1>Final Project Prototype</h1>
        <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
        <p>
          As covered in my project proposal above, I aimed to create a paint-like drawing app that would allow my user to draw anything they'd like
          along with having the ability to download their sketch once they were complete. This process can be seen in the gif below, and my prototype
          can be accessed <a href="https://cramos03.github.io/fp0Prototype/index.html">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          <div class="img" style="text-align:center">
            <img src="prototypeVid.gif" class="a">
          </div>
        </p>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <p>
          When first beginning the process of creating my prototype, I spent the early stages of my time figuring out how I'd implement a pen style tool.
          Rather than opting for my initially planned idea of using repeated circles like we did in the early P5 class activities, I instead used the line()
          function. This would allow for a "line" to be created for wherever my mouse was moving, and incorporated it into an if statement to assure that it
          was only occurring when the mouse was pressed.<br><br>
          From here, I followed the idea laid out in my protoype proposal of having two colors for now to choose form. The red would insure that my color was
          changing from the initial black pen color, and the white was a method for seeing if it'd function as a makeshift eraser tool. After adding these, I
          then finished off my prototype by adding a button to save my art and allow the canvas to be downloaded.<br><br>
          </p>
        <h2>Time Management</h2>
          <p>
          My prototype took a bit under the amount of time I originally expected it to take. I had expected to run into several issues when it came to both creating
          a continious line/pen tool, as well as for downloading my canvas. However, these tools were very easy to implement into my own application and tailor them
          to the needs of my drawing app.
          </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>
          When creating my prototype, there wasn't anything that caused a serious headache or required fixing. This was good to know since there were several
          helpful resources on the P5 webpage for working around any slight speedbumps that occurred, such as the line() function.
          </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <p>
          Below is a list of ideas or features that I may want to add to my project when creating the final version:
          <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Create a color wheel</li>
            <li>Develop varying brush styles (faded, blur, etc.)</li>
            <li>Add a slider for varying brush size, and keep this slider for different brush shapes</li>
            <li>Allow a user to download their art that only captures their canvas</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Project Scope & Implementation Plan</h2>
          <p>
          Upon completing my prototype, I've planned to remove the color palette/ellipses moving forward. This is due to the issue of the ellipses showing up in the 
          dowloaded canvas. This is an issue since, in my mind, a functional drawing app should not incorporate the icons and tool bar since it'll ruin the artwork.
          I've noticed that the Save Art button was not captured in the dowloaded file, so I will look towards either figuring out of there are certain tools that are
          omitted from the saveCanvas function, or if there is a way to limit the screenshot size to exclude any tools to the left of the screen. Because of this, I plan
          on spending the majority of my time on this issue, along with creating the final eraser tool and expanding the color selection options.
          </p>

        <h2>Kudos</h2>
          <p>
          I'd like to thank the P5 resources and demo pages since there were lots of helpful tools and information that helped me along the way when creating my prototype.
