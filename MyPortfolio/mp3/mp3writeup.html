      <h1>MP3 Writeup</h1>
      <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
      <p>
        For my web MP3 project introducing us to a modern web development toolchain, I attempted to make the game <a href="./dev-toolchain/index.html"> Pong
        </a>.<br><br>
        <div class="img" style="text-align:center">
          <img src="pong.png" class="a">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        As seen in my image above, I wanted to make it a two player game of Pong where I assigned the up and down arrow keys for the right
        paddle, while the W and S keys were assigned to the left paddle. Furthermore, my intention for this game was to have the ball launch in a random
        direction at the start to begin the match. I went with this option since I noticed that in the P5 library of Demos provided to us would land in
        a constant back and forth if neither player moved their paddle. My game is still under production since the ball does not continue moving once the
        game has begun and the paddles don't allow for repsonses when my keys are pressed.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
        When analyzing the steps I took to complete my page, it began with setting up the dev-toolchain via the activity that Hannah provided to us
        during class. From here, I wanted to familiarize myself with further P5 concepts and tools, so I ran through the endless runner example Hannah
        had shared as well. Along with this, I was able to use the P5 Pong demo as a launching point and combine the sprite tools from the endless runner
        to create each of my elements (ball, left paddle, right paddle).<br><br>
        Since I was on a time crunch, this overall game setup was easy to throw together and I simply adjusted the paddle placements and size to make the
        a bit more challenging. From here, I wanted to focus on adding a score tracker as the game progressed. This was done by identifying an area of out of
        bounds (aka beyond the paddles) that would then reset my ball to its originial position and add a point to the winning players score. For this, I 
        just needed to declare my score trackers at the start of my code to use later.<br><br>
        
        Finally, the last change I wanted to make from building off the original Pong demo was the ability to choose when to start. I didn't want the ball to launch
        right away, but instead when both players were ready and they had clicked to start the game. In theory, this would be done by announcing a variable to keep track
        if the game had started. This would declare True if the game had clicked, and return a result of False once either player had scored and the ball was returned to its
        original starting point.<br><br>
        </p>
      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
        Since my game is still under production, there were two main issues I had trouble solving. One issue I ran into during this assignment was having the ball begin once the game had been clicked. Initially, I thought the game wasn't returning a True 
        statement once the mouse was clicked, but figured that this was indeed not the issue afer changing the ball velocity variable to a latrger value and seeing it move once
        when the mouse was clicked, and never again. <br><br>
        Another issue I couldn't seem to solve was the paddle movement. After spending a few hours looking at the keyIsDown tool on the P5 library, I was stumped on why
        my paddles produce no movement for either player when any of the assigned keys are pressed.
        </p>
      <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
        For the future, here are some additional ideas/adjustments I might like to add to my game:
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Fix ball movement issue</li>
            <li>Fix paddle movement issue</li>
            <li>Add a score cap so that the game will end and announce the winner once this threshold is met</li>
            <li>Add powerups to either player (i.e., slow the other player's paddle down, increase ball speed for one player's hit, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
        A kudos I'd like to give is to the Platformer runner game for an easy introduction to setting up different variables and tools within a game. Along with this is the P5.play demos (specifically the Pong game) as well as their reference for clarification on varying sprite movements<br><br>
