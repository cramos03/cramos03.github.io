      <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
      <p>
        For my web extension, I settled on making a reminder that wuold alert the user to drink water. This alert would
        be dependent on how often the user chooses to alerted.<br><br>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="m1gif.gif" class="a">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        As seen in my gif, when attempting to use my web extension, it's as simple as submitting a duration, in minutes, for
        how often you want to be reminded. For the purpose of demonstration, my gif was set to 6 second alerts rather than minute intervals.
        Whenever you feel like stopping the reminders, these can be cleared and stopped by
        clicking the "Stop Reminders" button.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
        When analyzing the steps I took to complete my page, it mainly began with familiarizing myself with
        using any java script tools and techniques shared in class, along with communicating between my .js and .html files.<br><br>
        From here, I wanted to move forward with using some of the web extensions that were shared in class in order to begin looking
        at each individual piece in an attempt to gain an understanding on how the each extension was being put together. I then moved
        forward with selecting a web extension that would best suit my purpose in order to use it as a building block for developing my
        own extension.<br><br>
        When first beginning to create my web extension, I started off very slow with creating the necessary basics for what my extension
        would call for. This included things such as a box for user input, placeholders, and buttons to commit to each decision, whether it
        was setting a reminder or turning them off.<br><br>
        
        Following this, I went ahead and began working on setting up my reminder that would pop up in intervals at the desired rate of the user.
        This called for selecting a few ID's from my .html file in order to work with the assigned constants, along with incorporating an event
        listener so that my extension would know when to begin.<br><br>
        After this, I went ahead and finished off my extension by incorporating the setInterval tool that would establish an interval depending
        on the user's preference for how often they would like to be reminded.
        </p>
      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
        One issue I ran into during this assignment was attempting to setup my setInterval tool. We hadn't covered this tool in class until later
        on into the project, so I spent some time earlier getting familiar with how to incorporate it into my javascript file to assist with what
        I was aiming to do. I was mainly stuck on figuring out why my setInterval feature was alerting very rapidly one after the other.<br><br>
        I solved this issue when seeking help from Hannah who pointed out that this could be due to my setInterval tool being called within my event
        listener. This meant that upon clicking my "Remind Me" button, it would begin the alerts. To solve this, I instead embedded my setInterval
        within a function, along with the value entered by the user, and then called my function within the event listener.
        </p>
      <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
        For the future, here are some additional ideas/features I might like to add to my web extension:
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Add text within my popup tab that assures the user that their reminder has been either set or cleared</li>
            <li>Be able to clear previous reminders simply by just setting a new one</li>
            <li>Add clarification to my extension that doesn't begin the setInterval function until the user has cleared the alert popup</li>
            <li>Further overall design changes to make my extension look more professional</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
        A kudos I'd like to give is to Hannah and W3Schools where I was able to find the setInterval method, along with a few helpful examples using
        it in different ways.<br><br>
