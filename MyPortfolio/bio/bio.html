        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          As a passionate and motivated professional, Iâ€™m constantly striving 
          to improve my techniques, expand my skillset and find new opportunities to grow. 
        <br>
        <br>
          My focus is on being able to create enjoyable experiences for individuals by placing 
          great thought into sustainability, accessibility, and functionality when working on a project. 
          These can be exemplified throughout my work, which can be seen as a culmination of past learnings 
          and inspiration from readings covering human-computer interaction and design. Some examples include 
          Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristic Principles, and Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice.
        <br>
        <br>
          Each of my projects - both solo and collaborative - have provided growth and pushed me to strive 
          for establishing myself within the UX industry.
